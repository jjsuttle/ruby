# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:

# ruby 1-data.rb
# puts "Hello, world" 
# puts <- prints out the code 

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 7

# Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 7*8

# Strings
# puts "tacos"

# Combine strings together (the {} allows you to run code/calculations within a string)
# puts "#{3+3+3} tacos"

# Variables
quantity = 3+3+3
food = "tacos"

# Combine strings and variables
# puts "#{quantity} #{food}"

# String manipulation
# puts "hello".upcase
# puts "hello".reverse
# puts "hello".swapcase
